## WARNING
Using this LISENCE means that you NO LONGER have the RIGHT to DELETE or WITHDRAW your product, and ALL your rights to it will be SHARED by OTHERS. Due to malicious copying and other reasons, the use of SANSUICY LICENSE may cause your work to generate LESS direct benefits for you.

## HOW TO SET SANSUICY LISENCE TO YOUR PRODUCT?

Explicitly add "This work is released based on the SANSUICY LISENCE, and you can freely copy, modify, publish, and redistribute it. At the same time, the modified work is not required to comply with the SANSUICY LISENCE.", add the logo of SANSUICY LISENCE, or copy this file to your project, etc.

## INTRODUCTION

The SANSUICY (wine, sansicy, sansuishey, sensicy) LISENCE is a work-centered, copyright-light, work-evolution and attribution-focused copyright lisence. It is inspired by the evolution of several well-known novels in ancient China, e.g. *Romance of the Three Kingdoms*, *Water Margin*, and *Journey to the West*. We hope the SANSUICY LISENCE can become the standard lisence for literary sharing in a new era a thousand years from now. You can use this LISENCE on your literary works, such as literary works, drawings, music, pictures, videos, and games.

## DEFINITION
For a work P published by user (or legal person) A, if A specifies the SANSUICY LISENCE for work P, then, for all user or intelligent agent B and its product D resulting from the operation of P, there are:
1. RIGHT SHARING: B can copy (i.e. allowing D=P), publish, and modify work P at will, WITHOUT having to be reviewed by A, and WITHOUT having to cite it. More generally, B always has the SAME right to dispose of P as A.
2. IRREVOCABILITY: A and B cannot bind P and its derivative work D in ANY destructive way, such as by claiming back the work that has been copied by others, etc.
3. PATH OBLIGATION: If B creates the work D based on the works under SANSUICY LISENCE such as P, then B is obligated to maintain the RIGHT for its upstream works defined by SANSUICY LISENCE.
4. WORKS AS THE CENTER: When a dispute arises and is NOT within the scope of the above three rulings, the SANSUICY LISENCE gives the priority to ensuring the development of the work P and its derivative products D. The interests of A and B are not the primary needs.

## BACKGROUND
The SANSUICY LISENCE is derived from the creation procedure of traditional Chinese popular novels. It is named with the initials of the three most well-known works, *The Romance of the Three Kingdoms*, *The Outlaws of the Marsh*, and *Journey to the West*. At the beginning, these works were only scattered stories. Through the rich creators and artists for hundreds of years, they had a magnificent story volume. Then, through the deletion and collection of some scholars, they formed a relatively stable collection as the universal version. Take the book completion experience of the story *Journey to the West* as an example: during the Zhen-guan Period of the Tang Dynasty, Master Xuanzang went to Ancient India to seek scriptures and wrote the book *Great Tang Dynasty Journey to the Western Regions*. Later, the monk and apprentice wrote *the Biography of the Great Si-An Temple's Tripitaka Master*. In the Northern Song Dynasty, there were stories like *Monk Chen Guangrui on the River* and *Poems about Three Tibetan Scriptures in the Tang Dynasty*. At this time, there were monkey walkers in Huaguo Mountain, tree-man, women's country, deep sand gods and other elements. Later in the Yuan Dynasty, various Yuan dramas such as *Erlang God Locks the Heavenly Sage* further appeared, and the main story of *Journey to the West* has become more mature. By the Ming Dynasty, the story of *Journey to the West* was finally mature, and reached a certain height in literary and ideological level. Similarly, The *Outlaws of the Marsh* was formed on the basis of the *Songjiang Uprising*, *the Great Song Xuanhe Legacy*, and other stories such as *The Flower Monk*, *The Green Faced Beast*, etc.

After entering the modern society, with the popularity of the copyright system and the specialization of literary and artistic creators, there is not only a dispute between "popular" and "pure art" in literary and artistic works, but also the modification of works itself becomes difficult. The copyright system has adapted to the cultural productivity in a long period of time. On the one hand, it will provide a reproduction threshold for the rights and interests of creators and book printers. On the other hand, works also make literature and art show its value most clearly through commodity exchange. However, the copyright system has also caused the alienation of literary and artistic works. At the same time, the secondary processing of works becomes difficult, and there seems to be a default: the works created by great writers are perfect, and no one can modify it to make it better. The SANSUICY LISENCE aims to provide the hope for opposing these views.


## COMPARED TO EXISTING LISENCE

* CC-X. CC LISENCE allows free reprint and reproduction, but requires the signature and prohibits deduction. The works specified in CC LISENCE cannot be used by others in a commercial environment. Unlike the CC agreement, the above three requirements are not required in the SANSUICY LISENCE.

* GPL. The GPL LISENCE ensures the derivative works must use GPL LISENCE, too. This is not stipulated in the SANSUICY LISENCE.

* MIT. The MIT LISENCE requires the right of signature to be retained, but the SANSUICY LISENCE does not stipulate this. In fact, a large number of authors in SANSUICY's era deliberately released their works anonymously. Compared with name retention, this method also has some advantages. In addition, the SANSUICY LISENCE stipulates that all participants in the reproduction and modification of works must have the obligation to maintain the implementation of the SANSUICY LISENCE for works at their upstream works, which is not stipulated in the MIT LISENCE.
